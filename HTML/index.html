  		<h2>How it works?</h2>
			<p>Jola voice assistant is composed of two parts that are connected to each other. The one that you stick on your fridge which hears and speaks with you. And the other one that you place in your fridge. It is this last one that collects all the precious information. Thanks to its powerful detector it scans the nature of an item, the expiry date, the volume and the weight of it.<br>
			You can configure Jola as you wish. You can choose to have its reminders at a specific time of the day, to have it only when opening your fridge or even only when asking it.</p>

			<h2>Our brand</h2>
			<p>Jola is a French brand based in Paris. Founded in 2017, the project was born from the observation that, although our awareness of environmental issues rises, our behaviours are still not enought. One of the reasons? Our lack of time. We know that it takes time to find out the good alternatives to adopt, to track the expiry dates of all the items that you have in the fridge, to be attentive on the quantity of plastic you consume...<br> That is why Jola came to life. With Jola you have the good recommandations, at the the good time and based on your own consumption. All the more, Jola makes you explore new things by generating recipes that can get you out of the routine.
			</p>

			<strong>No more excuses to do its share in building a greener future. Start it today!</strong>
